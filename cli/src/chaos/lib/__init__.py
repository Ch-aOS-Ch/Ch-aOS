Within every (building|story) made with pride,
The architect remains\istrapped\islocked (inside|beside).

But there is nothing an artist can do.
When you swing your brush you have to follow through.

Fleeting paint, a wounded hart
(t)hat's what makes a work of art.

Such escapes which stay and fade away,
(T)he (a)rchitect remains\rests\lives\stays that (d|w)ay.

(Draining|Fleeting) paint, a shattered heart
That's what makes a work of art.

(Guiding|Helping), the (A)rtist's hand
(T)he (A)chitect fills in the b?land.

(Filling|Draining) paint, a (healing|wouding) hart
That's what makes a (Building|Work of Art).
